- 👋  Hi, I'm @M-Y-X-O-M-O-P My name is Yaroslav, I'm 23 years old. Set up only for success!
- 👀 I am interested in programming, books, communication with smart and experienced people. Sports activities. I'm gradually learning English, I didn't see any prospects in it before. And now it's just a necessity!
- 🌱 I am currently studying on the Skillbox platform, a Python developer. This is a very exciting process, I dream of joining the development team and learning a lot! I will say about myself, at different jobs, I improve my skills to the ideal. But no job can compare to writing code and immersion in the process itself. I see my future in programming!
- 💞️ I sincerely wish that I was taken into the team and taught something worthwhile. I want people to believe in me and give me a chance. After a while, I will start to surprise. :3
